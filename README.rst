Glyph
-----
Glyph uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to understand commit messages. This knowledge can be used for classifying commits into categories such as Bug-fixes, Feature additions, Improvements etc. 

* Using Glyph with `Kebechet <https://github.com/thoth-station/kebechet>`_, smart CHANGELOG entries out of commit messages can be generated.
* Glyph can also be used as a standlone library for analyzing commits from a locally stored repository (see usage below)

Running this project from Git
=============================

.. code-block:: console

  git clone git@github.com:thoth-station/glyph.git  # or use https
  cd glyph
  pipenv install --dev
  PYTHONPATH=. pipenv run ./thoth-glyph --help


Installing this project from PyPI
=================================

This project is available on PyPI, to install it:

.. code-block:: console

  pip install thoth-glyph
  
Features
=================================
* **Commit Classification:** Singular commits can be classified using the following command:
.. code-block:: console

  thoth-glyph classify -m "COMMIT MESSAGE TO BE ANALYZED"
  
* **Classifying Multiple Commits:** Mulitple commit can be classified together using the classify-repo command. By default, this action classifies all the commits in the repository. Optionally, a date-range (YYYY-MM-DD) can be provided:
.. code-block:: console

  thoth-glyph classify-repo --path /path/to/git/repo --start 2020-05-01 --end 2020-05-10
  
* **Classifying Using Tags:** Commits can also be picked using git tags. The following command will pick commits between the tags v3.7.1 and v3.7.2
.. code-block:: console

  thoth-glyph classify-repo-by-tag --path /path/to/git/repo --start_tag v3.7.1 --end_tag v3.7.2
  
Sample Usage
=================================

.. code-block:: console

  [tussharm@tussharm glyph]$ thoth-glyph classify -m "Fixed server bug that impacted performance"

Integration with Kebechet
=================================
Kebechet can use Glyph by reading the project's configuration from .thoth.yaml file. Glyph's supported formatters and ML classifers can be specified in this configuration file. 

* See sample manager configuration `here <https://github.com/thoth-station/kebechet/tree/master/kebechet/managers/version>`_
* See sample changelog generated using Glyph `here <https://github.com/tushar7sharma/release-log-test/blob/master/SAMPLE_CHANGELOG.md>`_

Model and Dataset
=================================
Currently Glyph ships with a model trained using Facebook's `fasttext <https://fasttext.cc/>`_ library over a dataset of ~5000 commits collected from multiple large-scale open source projects (see referred publications for more details). The library can be easily extended to accomodate more models. Developers are welcome to contribute and improve the classification accuracy.
