__label__features "[jira] [HBASE-5074] Support checksums in HBase- block cache--Author: Dhruba--Summary:-HFile is enhanced to store a checksum for each block. HDFS checksum verification-is avoided while reading data into the block cache. On a checksum verification-failure  we retry the file system read request with hdfs checksums switched on-(thanks Todd).--I have a benchmark that shows that it reduces iops on the disk by about 40%. In-this experiment  the entire memory on the regionserver is allocated to the-regionserver's jvm and the OS buffer cache size is negligible. I also measured-negligible (<5%) additional cpu usage while using hbase-level checksums.--The salient points of this patch:--1. Each hfile's trailer used to have a 4 byte version number. I enhanced this so-that these 4 bytes can be interpreted as a (major version number  minor-version). Pre-existing hfiles have a minor version of 0. The new hfile format-has a minor version of 1 (thanks Mikhail). The hfile major version remains-unchanged at 2. The reason I did not introduce a new major version number is-because the code changes needed to store/read checksums do not differ much from-existing V2 writers/readers.--2. Introduced a HFileSystem object which is a encapsulates the FileSystem-objects needed to access data from hfiles and hlogs.  HDFS FileSystem objects-already had the ability to switch off checksum verifications for reads.--3. The majority of the code changes are located in hbase.io.hfie package. The-retry of a read on an initial checksum failure occurs inside the hbase.io.hfile-package itself.  The code changes to hbase.regionserver package are minor.--4. The format of a hfileblock is the header followed by the data followed by the-checksum(s). Each 16 K (configurable) size of data has a 4 byte checksum.  The-hfileblock header has two additional fields: a 4 byte value to store the-bytesPerChecksum and a 4 byte value to store the size of the user data-(excluding the checksum data). This is well explained in the associated-javadocs.--5. I added a test to test backward compatibility. I will be writing more unit-tests that triggers checksum verification failures aggressively. I have left a-few redundant log messages in the code (just for easier debugging) and will-remove them in later stage of this patch.

On t1  a message is received and isConnected is false. The message-   will be queued.-2. On t2  CONNECTED is received from the broker. isConnected is set-   to true  the queue is drained and the queued messages are forwarded-3. On t1  the message is added to the queue--To fix this  checking that isConnected is false (step 1 above) and the-queueing of a message (step 3 above) need to be performed as a unit-so that the flushing of the queued messages can't be interleaved. This-is achieved by synchronizing on a monitor and performing steps 1-and 3 and synchronizing on the same monitor while performing step 2.--The monitor is held while the messages are actually being forwarded-to the broker. An alternative would be to drain the queue into-a local variable  release the monitor  and then forward the messages.-The main advantage of this alternative is that the monitor is held for-less time. It also reduces the theoretical risk of deadlock by not-holding the monitor while making an alien call. The downside of the-alternative is that it may lead to messages being forwarded out of-order.

HA Manager stores the existing snapshot of the VM state machine.  Before working on HA for a VM  it checks to see if that snapshot has been changed.  So by not scheduling HA work  we've effectively made HA not work under multi-failure situations.  I've fixed by removing that code and instead at the time of performing HA  do a quick check to see if there are pwork underway for the same VM and work scheduled in the future for that VM.  If there are work scheduled in the future  then we simply cancel the current work.  If there are already work underway  then we retry again in 1 minute."

__label__corrective "CS-16544: Create Snapshot (2nd time - reccuring) is failing on XenServer 6.1. The issue is that while backing up a snapshot when cloudstack tries to update the parent (of the backed up vhd)  vhd-util isn't present at the desired location and setParent function in vmopsSnapshot fails. This issue is observed only on Xenserver 6.1. The reason for this is  when to a Xenserver and executes the SetupCommand  it copies vhd-util tool to /opt/xensource/bin directory on the host. However  in vmopsSnapshot python file 'VHD_UTIL' is initialized to /usr/sbin/. The issue is not observed on 6.0.2 (and I guess previous versions) because vhd-util is present in /usr/sbin/ directory by default (after a clean install). Whereas  in Xenserver 6.1  vhd-util is present in '/usr/bin'. Fixed the issue by updating VHD_UTIL to point to /opt/xensource/bin/vhd-util in vmopsSnapshot file."

Think about it.  Why would anyone want to call one dao function  switch transaction  and then switch back.  The right thing is for the caller to switch transaction  call a series of dao codes  and switch it back.  That's the semantics I changed to.

__label__features "Implement reading from null safe dereferences

Null safe dereferences make handling null or missing values shorter.
Compare without:
```
if (ctx._source.missing != null && ctx._source.missing.foo != null) {
  ctx._source.foo_length = ctx.source.missing.foo.length()
}
```

To with:
```
Integer length = ctx._source.missing?.foo?.length();
if (length != null) {
  ctx._source.foo_length = length
}
```

Combining this with the as of yet unimplemented elvis operator allows
for very concise defaults for nulls:
```
ctx._source.foo_length = ctx._source.missing?.foo?.length() ?: 0;
```

Since you have to start somewhere  we started with null safe dereferenes.

Anyway  this is a feature borrowed from groovy. Groovy allows writing to
null values like:
```
def v = null
v?.field = 'cat'
```
And the writes are simply ignored. Painless doesn't support this at this
point because it'd be complex to implement and maybe not all that useful.

There is no runtime cost for this feature if it is not used. When it is
used we implement it fairly efficiently  adding a jump rather than a
temporary variable.

This should also work fairly well with doc values."

HA Manager stores the existing snapshot of the VM state machine.  Before working on HA for a VM  it checks to see if that snapshot has been changed.  So by not scheduling HA work  we've effectively made HA not work under multi-failure situations.  I've fixed by removing that code and instead at the time of performing HA  do a quick check to see if there are pwork underway for the same VM and work scheduled in the future for that VM.  If there are work scheduled in the future  then we simply cancel the current work.  If there are already work underway  then we retry again in 1 minute."

Netty uses the number of processors for sizing various resources (e.g.

of available processors which might not match the configured number of
processors as set in Elasticsearch to limit the number of threads (for
example  in Docker containers). A new feature was added to Netty that
enables configuring the number of processors Netty should see for sizing
this various resources. This commit takes advantage of this feature to
set this number of available processors to be equal to the configured
number of processors set in Elasticsearch.

__label__features "Reindex from remote

This adds a remote option to reindex that looks like

```
curl -POST 'localhost:9200/_reindex?pretty' -d'{
  ""source"": {
    ""remote"": {
      ""host"": ""http://otherhost:9200""
    } 
    ""index"": ""target"" 
    ""query"": {
      ""match"": {
        ""foo"": ""bar""
      }
    }
  } 
  ""dest"": {
    ""index"": ""target""
  }
}'
```

This reindex has all of the features of local reindex:
* Using queries to filter what is copied
* Retry on rejection
* Throttle/rethottle
The big advantage of this version is that it goes over the HTTP API
which can be made backwards compatible.

Some things are different:

The query field is sent directly to the other node rather than parsed
on the coordinating node. This should allow it to support constructs
that are invalid on the coordinating node but are valid on the target
node. Mostly  that means old syntax."

The PercolatorFieldMapper stores the rewritten form of each percolator query's xcontext
in a binary doc values field. This make sure that the query rewrite happens only during
indexing (some queries for example fetch shapes  terms in remote indices) and
the speed up the loading of the queries in the percolator query cache.

Because the percolator now works inside the search infrastructure a number of features
(sorting fields  pagination  fetch features) are available out of the box.

Whenever the panes are reordered  the current position of each visible pane is recorded in the application preferences  so the user's custom ordering can be preserved when JabRef is next run."

If the pushing account is an administrator  the created repository may be
located in any folder/project space.  This reposiory will inherit the server's
default access restriction and authorization control.  The repository owner
will be the pushing account.

If the pushing account is a regular user with the CREATE role  the repository
can only be located in the account's personal folder (~username/myrepo.git).
This repository will be VIEW restricted and accessible by NAMED users.  The

There's no real reason for the DAO code to add special semantics to use a different DB connection.  That can be done by simply switching the transaction before it even reached the dao code.  Think about it.  Why would anyone want to call one dao function  switch transaction  and then switch back when it fails.  The right thing is for the caller to switch transaction  call a series of dao codes  and switch it back in case it is invalid.  That's the semantics I changed to.  By doing this  it also eliminates the number of debug messages in this bug."

The shards preference on a search request enables specifying a list of
shards to hit  and then a secondary preference (e.g.  ""_primary"") can be
added. Today  the separator between the shards list and the secondary
preference is ';'. Unfortunately  this is also a valid separtor for URL
query parameters. This means that a preference like ""_shards:0;_primary""
will be parsed into two URL parameters: ""_shards:0"" and ""_primary"". With
the recent change to strict URL parsing  the second parameter will be
rejected  ""_primary"" is not a valid URL parameter on a search
request. This means that this feature has never worked (unless the ';'
is escaped  but no one does that because our docs do not that  and there
was no indication from Elasticsearch that this did not work). This
commit changes the separator to '|'.

This commit moves away from using stripe RAID-0 simumlation across multiple

supported but shards and it's data is not striped across multiple paths / disks.
This will for instance prevent to loose all shards if a single disk is corrupted.

Indices that are using this features already will automatically upgraded to a single
datapath based on a simple diskspace based heuristic. In general there must be enough
diskspace to move a single shard at any time otherwise the upgrade will fail.

If the thread pools of an elasticsearch node cannot be shutdown

for a service to shutdown before a KILL signal is sent  resulting
in an unclean shutdown - not from an elasticsearch point of view 
but from init system point of view  as some lock files are left
around.

In order to prevent this the init script as well as the systemd
configuration now feature the same timeout than the debian package 
which is 20 seconds.

This patch takes the version of the created index into account when a

So  if an index was created with 0.90.4  then the prebuilt analyzers
will be the same than on the 0.90.4 release.

One reason for this feature is the possibility to change pre built
analyzers like the standard one.

The patch tries to reuse analyzers as mutch as possible. So even if
version X.Y.Z and X.Y.A use the same lucene analyzers  the same instance
is reused in order to prevent overcreation of lucene analyzer instances.

__label__features "Enable validation of Optional values

To validate values contained in an `Optional` type  we need to use a new
feature in Hibernate Validator 5.1  so this introduces a dependency
version bump to 5.1.1.

This makes use of an *experimental* feature in Hibernate Validator  so
I'm not 100% sure we'll want to make use of it yet.

To validate the contents of an `Optional`  you need to include an
`@UnwrapValidatedValue` annotation on the property being validated:

```java
@Length(min = 32  max = 32)
@UnwrapValidatedValue
private Optional<String> md5 = Optional.absent();
```

Absent values are considered `null` when validated  so their behaviour
depends on your chosen constraints' handling of `null` values.

We have to register this inside `Bootstrap`  and I noticed that we don't
(currently) expose a way for users to register more validation behaviour
through `Bootstrap`  so we should probably look in to that."

__label__perfective Rather than blindly remove hydrogens we now only remove hydrogens we can accurately represent as implicit. Previously with molecular hydrogen an empty structure was returned - molecular hydrogen is now preserved. This makes more sense as we can then convert to/from explicit hydrogen without losing atoms - an empty structure definitely doesn’t represent molecular hydrogen and so ‘add explicit hydrogens’ would not put back in the correct number of atoms.

__label__perfective "The libs have been removed from the repository to avoid increasing its size (a README file has been added with instructions on how to obtain the necessary JDT libs). JDX now uses a smarter structure to store source code (i.e.  it is no more duplicated inside types and methods - instead  they recover their source code from the compilation unit's source code). This makes the DependencyReport much more lightweight. Type equal's method now checks for their parent compilation unit. Only a single source directory is now alloed (simplifies model). Method have a new attribute that holds its javadoc. Other smaller changes here and there (but no changes to the dependency extraction itself)"
