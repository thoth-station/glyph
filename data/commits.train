__label__features "implement reading from null safe dereferences

null safe dereferences make handling null or missing values shorter . 
compare without:
```
if  ( ctx . _source . missing  ! = null && ctx . _source . missing . foo  ! = null )  {
  ctx . _source . foo_length = ctx . source . missing . foo . length (  ) 
}
```

to with:
```
integer length = ctx . _source . missing ?  . foo ?  . length (  ) ;
if  ( length  ! = null )  {
  ctx . _source . foo_length = length
}
```

combining this with the as of yet unimplemented elvis operator allows
for very concise defaults for nulls:
```
ctx . _source . foo_length = ctx . _source . missing ?  . foo ?  . length (  )   ? : 0;
```

since you have to start somewhere  we started with null safe dereferenes . 

anyway  this is a feature borrowed from groovy .  groovy allows writing to
null values like:
```
def v = null
v ?  . field =  ' cat ' 
```
and the writes are simply ignored .  painless doesn ' t support this at this
point because it ' d be complex to implement and maybe not all that useful . 

there is no runtime cost for this feature if it is not used .  when it is
used we implement it fairly efficiently  adding a jump rather than a
temporary variable . 

this should also work fairly well with doc values . "

__label__features "set available processors for netty

netty uses the number of processors for sizing various resources  ( e . g .  
thread pools  buffer pools  etc .  )  .  however  it uses the runtime number
of available processors which might not match the configured number of
processors as set in elasticsearch to limit the number of threads  ( for
example  in docker containers )  .  a new feature was added to netty that
enables configuring the number of processors netty should see for sizing
this various resources .  this commit takes advantage of this feature to
set this number of available processors to be equal to the configured
number of processors set in elasticsearch .

this adds a remote option to reindex that looks like

```
curl -post  ' localhost:9200 / _reindex ? pretty '  -d ' {
  ""source"": {
    ""remote"": {
      ""host"": ""http: /  / otherhost:9200""

      }
    }
  } 
  ""dest"": {
    ""index"": ""target""
  }
} ' 
```

this reindex has all of the features of local reindex:
* using queries to filter what is copied
* retry on rejection
* throttle / rethottle
the big advantage of this version is that it goes over the http api
which can be made backwards compatible . 

some things are different:

the query field is sent directly to the other node rather than parsed
on the coordinating node .  this should allow it to support constructs
that are invalid on the coordinating node but are valid on the target
node .  mostly  that means old syntax . "

preference is  ' ; '  .  unfortunately  this is also a valid separtor for url

will be parsed into two url parameters: ""_shards:0"" and ""_primary"" .  with
the recent change to strict url parsing  the second parameter will be
rejected  ""_primary"" is not a valid url parameter on a search

if the thread pools of an elasticsearch node cannot be shutdown
immediately  a wait of 10 seconds is added .  this clashes with the
rpm scripts  as by default the init functions wait for 3 seconds
for a service to shutdown before a kill signal is sent  resulting
in an unclean shutdown - not from an elasticsearch point of view 
but from init system point of view  as some lock files are left
around . 

in order to prevent this the init script as well as the systemd
configuration now feature the same timeout than the debian package 
which is 20 seconds . 

the await statement  which causes the 10 second delay can be found in
internalnode . close (  ) "

so  if an index was created with 0 . 90 . 4  then the prebuilt analyzers
will be the same than on the 0 . 90 . 4 release . 

one reason for this feature is the possibility to change pre built
analyzers like the standard one . 

the patch tries to reuse analyzers as mutch as possible .  so even if
version x . y . z and x . y . a use the same lucene analyzers  the same instance
is reused in order to prevent overcreation of lucene analyzer instances .

to validate values contained in an `optional` type  we need to use a new
feature in hibernate validator 5 . 1  so this introduces a dependency
version bump to 5 . 1 . 1 . 

this makes use of an *experimental* feature in hibernate validator  so
i ' m not 100% sure we ' ll want to make use of it yet . 

to validate the contents of an `optional`  you need to include an
`@unwrapvalidatedvalue` annotation on the property being validated:

```java
@length ( min = 32  max = 32 ) 
@unwrapvalidatedvalue
private optional<string> md5 = optional . absent (  ) ;
```

absent values are considered `null` when validated  so their behaviour
depends on your chosen constraints '  handling of `null` values . 

we have to register this inside `bootstrap`  and i noticed that we don ' t
 ( currently )  expose a way for users to register more validation behaviour
through `bootstrap`  so we should probably look in to that . "

* support dropwizard applications without logback

this is a prototype for splitting the tight integration between dropwizard and logback . 
this feature was requested several times  ( see #1637 )  .  the idea is too provide users the
ability to exclude logback from dropwizard and replace it with an external logging
solution  if they really want to .  the main work of this pr is too initialize the logback
infrastructure lazily  so the user can swap it to an external logging mechanism in the
config file . 

* mention in the docs how do exclude logback

for people who use spark which forces log4j2 . 

* add #1900 to the release notes"
